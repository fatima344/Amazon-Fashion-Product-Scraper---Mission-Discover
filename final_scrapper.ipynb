Such as a couple of hours a day doing farm chores, perfect for that.If its cold out, and the boots are cool/cold, such as from sitting over night in an unheated garage,  your feet are going to be cold, even with wool socks. These things get cold and stay that way for a long time. If you start the day with these cold your feet are going to freeze all day. I can feel them sucking the heat out of my feet.I have huge calves and struggle to wear rubber boots besides ankle boots. The sheaths on these are larger than average and they just fit. I wish they were a little bigger to make it easier to tuck my pants into.I wear 10.5 in Ariat square toes, which start tight and break in just right. I bought these in an 11 and even with thick wool socks they are too loose.They offer no ankle support. The sheath material is very pliable, they won't even stand up under their own weight. That being said the design is very trim, not clunky.They have very aggressive tread, which for my use is a good thing, I bought them to slop around in the winter clay mud.Bottom line: for occasional use, on a budget these are hard to beat, if you plan on working in them all day every day look elsewhere if your budget permits. And remember these are made in the US at competitive prices to other options... that is reason enough to buy them over other options in the price range.\",\n",

I mostly wear the sketchers \"middle aged dad\" wide fit shoes that are well known for being pretty close to slippers comfort but also have to wear steel toes for work so I have good comparison points. These are very close to the sketchers, not quite, but enough that more often than not I end up wearing these instead as they are still super comfortable. I normally wear a 12 wide, so I bought a 12 regular expecting it to stretch and it in fact was very narrow and tight at first. The third use it felt great, the 5th time (after having walked about a mile in total in them) they were broken in. After wearing about 50 times now I can say that I love these and they fit me nearly perfect. The laces provided are too short for the number of eyelets in my opinion so I dont tie the top 2 rows (or maybe my feet are actually too wide) and the toe was longer than expected. These are not shiny, a matte black so they dont stand out too much, but nice enough to use as casual dress shoes. However due to the lower shine they are super easy to clean and dont show scratches as much, fairly durable so far. If there are scraches or cracks on mine I havent found them yet. Perfect for lots of walking, has a similar spring and cushon in your step comparable to name brand crocs, but you know way more comfortable. Warm enough for mild cold with thick socks which even fit with me despite how tight they were, but not too hot with thin sport socks even in the summer. Sure they arent gonna handle snow and ice that well but for Louisiana winters they are perfect, however I wear mine year around even in summer, they are just that good.',\n",

Wished they were waterproof with the same design and all. I work ems in nyc and use these for 8-16hrs, 4-5 times a week. They’re light weight so you can run to save your fellow mos on a 10-13. They feel like sneakers, comfy and LIGHT weight. The only thing is they wear off after a year and a half use. Will buy again tho ! Highly recommend ! you can do your stairchair with ease with your fellow lift assist 😅',\n",

I have been using different ones since 2010.The only downside is the soles are squeaky on tile, concrete…Also they are not nearly as good gripping as Bates and Danner’s, Cabellas…I have worn over they years.However they fit the BEST by major leaps and bounds!I wear them to the gym and have run in them a bunch as they fit better than running shoes.They have easy pull on straps on both sides and even feel awesome when not zipped up so they work great for quick on and off when just need them to run outside for something or to pop off when driving for long hauls and putting back on quick.Will buy again for sure.I am sooooooo hoping UA makes same boot w/better soles. If so I will buy 3 more pair right away just to have for future.',\n",

I spend slot of time on hard surfaces like concrete or asphalt and they are very comfortable. After an 8 or 16 hour shift, my feet aren’t hurting. The only complaints I have are that the soles are kind of soft, great for comfort but they wear down a little faster than I’d like. Also it might be personal preference but I find the laces aren’t that good. Every pair I’ve had, the laces break long before the boots wear out. But if laces are all I really have problems with then that is fine by me.',\n",
