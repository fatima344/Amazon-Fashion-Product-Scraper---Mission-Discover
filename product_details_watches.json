I've been using this watch for years, and it never ceases to amaze me with its reliability.First and foremost, the watch's design is a timeless classic. Its simple and clean aesthetic makes it suitable for any occasion. Whether I'm going to the gym, dressing up for a formal event, or just running errands, this watch fits seamlessly into my style.The durability of this watch is second to none. I've accidentally bumped it against various surfaces, and it has held up remarkably well. It's also water-resistant, so I don't have to worry about it getting wet in the rain or during a quick swim.One of the standout features of the F91W-1 is its incredible battery life. I can go years without having to replace the battery, which is a huge money-saver and a convenience that's hard to beat.The watch's digital display is clear and easy to read, even in bright sunlight. The backlight is handy for checking the time in the dark. It also offers basic features like an alarm and a stopwatch, which are surprisingly useful for everyday tasks and timing activities.The strap is comfortable and adjusts easily to fit various wrist sizes. I often forget I'm even wearing it because it's so lightweight and comfortable.But perhaps the best part of the Casio F91W-1 is its affordability. It provides exceptional value for the price. You get a reliable timepiece that lasts for years without breaking the bank. It's perfect for people of all ages, from kids learning to tell time to adults who appreciate a reliable everyday watch.I will say that another watch that I've also enjoyed is the simple black G shock here.https://amzn.to/3TgVgYZI has a look in a watch that I find simple, fashionable, and enjoyable to wear.",

No pointless extra stuff. Easy enough to figure out how to set even if you've never done it before, without directions. Slim profile, sturdy enough band. And if it breaks or if the battery just dies (shouldn't happen for years), super cheap to replace with a new F-91W. First time I have bought a style variation of the original, and I plan on getting other styles to bolster my accessory selection!",

                    "review": "My new Casio F91W-1 Classic Resin Strap Digital Sport Watch with white face and clear plastic wrist band is what I needed for a particular purpose.  I need something about once a week that is very inconspicuous.  I'm not trying to hide it, but I don't want it to grab peoples attention.  Just be there doing the job without being in the way.  This fits the bill.  The photos give you a good view of how clear the band is.  It is small for a full grown man, and could easily be worn by a woman or younger person, but again, that fits my purposes very well.  The digital readout is clear and easy to read.  The buttons are large enough and protrude enough that that are easy for even elderly fingers to push for the light or to change modes or set the time.  As far as accuracy goes, I'm very satisfied, but not thrilled.  Comparing it to the world clock official time it has gained approximately 1/2 to 2/3 second in the past week. \"Your mileage may vary\". That's really pretty good.  That means I'll only have to reset it every month or so and only then if I'm really obsessed with accuracy to the second, which for my purposes is not necessary.  For a convenient, pretty accurate and very budget friendly time piece this watch really checks the boxes for me.  I've had good luck with Casio in both quality for the price . . . or \"value\", and functionality in the past.  Of course, if something changes in the next few months to a year or so I'll be updating this review.",

                    "review": "I\u2019m over big, bulky watches.  I\u2019ve got my Suunto and a couple G-Shock watches.  I still wear them, still love them, but mostly I just want a watch that keeps nice, precise time, doesn\u2019t stand out from my wrist 3/4 inch and hopefully looks juuuust a little dorky.  I\u2019m also cheap.  Waterproofness is important to me.  I work a desk job.  I commute by bus or train- watches help with that.  I like to go on a run a couple times a week and wear a watch.  I don\u2019t sleep or shower with my watch on unless I\u2019m camping or in a hotel.  I like digital over analog because I kind of like to know exactly what time I think it is and I only ever estimate when I\u2019m reading an analog watch because I\u2019m lazy.  Also, when I\u2019m in a meeting or I\u2019ve been pinned-down by someone I don\u2019t want to talk to and I want to know if this really is taking forever or if my perception of the passage of time is just being warped- it\u2019s easier to sneak a peek at a digital watch and get a precise read.  I realized a few months ago that I really am just as happy wearing a $15 Casio as I am with my $250 Suunto and that most days I don\u2019t need to know the barometric pressure.  Some days, yes.  Most days, no.  But I like having a variety of watches (including the Suunto, which is fabulous).  And I like to choose which watch to wear each morning.  That\u2019s fun for me.  Recently I got on Amazon and ordered a bunch of new cheap Casio watches.  I got four new watches for $52.  I think Timex\u2019s are over-priced.  That\u2019s how cheap I am.Casio W-800HAV ($20-ish) Digital Black.  My eight-year old son and I each got one of these watches for Christmas 2016.  We both love it.  We both have other watches but wear this one the most.  It has a fairly low profile- doesn\u2019t catch on pockets or shirt sleeves.  I love the light- it looks stupid, like piddly.  But it actually lights the face well.  I go jogging at night sometimes.  The light works well enough for me to see how slow I am even while I\u2019m bouncing down the road.  And it\u2019s got \u201cDual Display\u201d.  I don\u2019t know what else to call that.  It shows the time on one part of the screen and at the same time it show the stopwatch numbers.  Nice to keep track of both.  Or, If I\u2019m out and about, I\u2019ll set a stopwatch when the train goes by because I know that the train comes by every 15 minutes.  So I can see when I\u2019m coming up on another 15-minute mark and also see the time on the sub-display.Casio F-201WA ($10.47)  Digital Black. Comfortable.  Lightweight.  Easiest buttons to push.  Good light.  I like that it has countdown timer and lots of alarms.  I miss being able to see the time when it\u2019s in stopwatch mode like I can with the W-800HAV and the WV-200A.Casio WV-200A ($40-ish) Waceceptor Digital Black with chrome and red.  Looks good.  Like the steel case.  Good protection for the glass.  Relatively heavy.  A liiiiitle too thick.  Really nice buttons.  Great electro-luminescent light.  This one is the only watch of the group that you can set it so it doesn\u2019t beep every time you push a button.  I really like being able to turn the beep off.  Sometimes I like to set a stopwatch in a meeting so I can see how long somebody is going on with some bullsh*t.  Strangely, timing somebody\u2019s bullsh*t is a nice distraction from the bullsh*t.  But I don\u2019t like my watch to beep when I\u2019m doing pushing buttons.  \u201cDual display\u201d- you can still see what time it is when you\u2019re in other modes.  Countdown timer is nice and many of my other watches don\u2019t have one.  I don\u2019t give it extra points for the whole Wave Ceptor thing.  Doesn\u2019t add any value for me and it kinda sucks battery.  This watch has been on my wrist for a full day of snorkelling and handled it beautifully.  I live in a land-locked state, so when I get to the ocean, I\u2019m in the water ALL DAY LONG.  I can\u2019t dive deeper than maybe 20 feet, so it\u2019s not a serious test for a watch that says it\u2019s good to 200m.  But if you\u2019re diving to 200m and time is critical, you\u2019re going to spring for something more than a $40 Casio.  (I love you, Casio).Casio HDA-600 ($14.79)  Black Analog.  Not the most comfortable.  Kinda squeezes my wrist from bone to bone or flops around a bit.  I dunno, it just fits weird.  YMMV.  Love the face protector.  Can\u2019t wait until it starts to look a little banged up.  Glowy dots on the hands aren\u2019t really impressive.  Date window works perfectly.  Looks tough but it\u2019s probably not.  I like it a lot.Casio MQ24-7B2 ($14-something)  White-faced Analog. Incredibly light.  Truly forget that you\u2019re wearing it.  Easy to read.  No date window.  No lumi.  Nice, simple and never catches your sleeve in a dress shirt. Yes, I\u2019m fancy.  Some people are smart enough to read an analog watch that doesn\u2019t have numbers on it- just dots.  I\u2019m not one of those people.  I screw it up enough when there\u2019s numbers.  This has numbers.  I like numbers.  Haven\u2019t tested this one for waterproofyness.  Casio only says it\u2019s water resistant.  I hardly ever do underwater demolitions anymore.Casio A168W-1 ($16.15) Stainless Digital. I love / hate this watch.  I don\u2019t know if Casio was really trying to make a watch that looks fancy but it\u2019s really a dork-bomb, or if they we\u2019re going for dork-bomb as their aim.  Either way.  This watch is a stunning success.  I think this watch is the pinnacle of nerd-swank. 1980\u2019s wannabe stockbroker, cool old guy who doesn\u2019t give a sh*t, little bit of silver under the sleeve to catch someone\u2019s eye- oh wait it\u2019s a friggin Casio digital.  I mean, it\u2019s chrome-plated PLASTIC for crying out loud.  How awesome is that?  I love all of that.  Love it.  It\u2019s got the Illuminator light, which works great.  Clock, date, stopwatch and alarm.  No countdown timer. The metal band is not comfortable.  It\u2019s got edges and it pulls on my arm fur.  Clasp works great and it\u2019s wicked-easy to adjust.  Slips under a dress shirt easily.  Again: super-dorky.  Makes me smile every time I put it on.  Then wince when it pulls the fur.Casio F91W-1 ($11.35) Black Digital.  I like this watch a lot.  It\u2019s super thin.  Very lightweight.  The light looks stupid but it works well.  The buttons are easy to hit.  It ranks pretty high on the \u2018Dork\u2019 scale.  People recognize it.  Hold that one button down and it says CASIo.  It\u2019s great.  Proud to say I\u2019ve never worn this watch along with flannel and a beanie.  Never.",

                    "review": "I had been looking for a relatively cheap digital watch, preferably from Casio, as a simple watch to start the New Year off with. When I searched \"casio digital watch\" this was about the second product listing, so I knew it had to be a decent watch. I had worn it for a day or two and have since replaced it with the [insert link here]. Here is my review of the Casio F91W-1 and an explanation of why I replaced it.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Design & Build:For just over $10, this Casio has great build quality and a cool retro design. In fact, the Casio F91W has been produced since 1991 and even has its own Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_F-91W) page! The design of the Casio is simple and classic and is probably one of the reasons why this watch is still successful after 25 years! The watch is very thin, - only 8 millimeters - especially for a digital watch, which is about the same thickness as an iPhone 5. The watch face is made of plastic and is not recessed into the body, meaning that while it is flush with the casing it can be scratched easily. The casing of the watch is made of resin which is pretty standard in most digital watches. The band is also made of resin and is comfortable enough for a $10 watch. One complaint that I have about the watches build quality is the material of which the band buckle is made of. The band buckle is made of ordinary black plastic which I can see breaking in a year or two. While I can't vouch for the longevity of this watch, I can almost confidently say that that plastic buckle will be the first part to break. Other than that, the watch features nice easy-to-press buttons which stick out from the watch a millimeter or two. The buttons are very easy to press, which can be both a good thing and a bad thing as they might be pressed accidentally. The top left button activates the display light which is very weak and only lights up from one side of the display, meaning that the left part of the display is kind of bright while the further you get to the right side of the display the light dims drastically. This seems like one of the areas Casio had to cut corners with in order to cut the cost, however, it is only a minor complaint with a $10 watch. The light shines a green light and only turns on while the button is depressed, which is kind of annoying. Digital watches I have owned in the past stayed on for a few seconds, but again, this is only a minor complaint with a $10 watch. Finally, the Casio features water RESISTANCE, not waterproofing, therefore I wouldn't go swimming with it, however, other users have reported diving with it so the decision is ultimately up to you. Overall, the Casio F91W features a simple and timeless design, as well as pretty good build quality for $10. The display light has some issues and the watch is only water resistant, but these things don't matter too much in a $10 watch.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Fit:I have around a 6-inch wrist and this watch fit great. I used a hole more towards the end of the band away from the case and it fit comfortably while not being too loose. The watch is very light and once it is on you almost forget it is there. The case is also thin and doesn't add much bulk to your arm. For me, the watch face was a good size proportionate to my wrist. It might have been a little small for my liking but it definitely didn't get in the way. Overall, I am happy with how the F91W fit on my wrist.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall:This watch is a great watch for the price. While I can't vouch for the longevity of this watch, I can say that it features a great design and decent build quality, as well as a good and comfortable fit (at least for my wrists). To conclude, if you have a bit over $10 to spend on a digital watch, you really can't go wrong with the Casio F91W.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Pros:- Classic simple design- Decent build quality- Comfortable- Thin and light- Easy-to-press buttons- Good fit for me- Accurate time-keeping (Casio claims that the watch is accurate to \u00b130 seconds per month due to the quartz movement of the watch)Cons:- Weak plastic band buckle- Easily scratched plastic face- Weak and poorly designed display light- Buttons may get accidentally pressed- Only water resistant---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Why I Replaced it:Even though the Casio F91W is a great watch for the money, I decided I wanted something a bit nicer, even if it meant spending a little bit more money.

                    "review": "There's nothing bad I can say about the watch. Seriously. I'm a 16 year old kid (you know how reckless we can get) who has had this for I think over a year now, and I can honestly say this thing is REALLY DURABLE!!*How durable* you ask?I wear this thing to school nearly everyday, never having to worry about it. Yes, that means I travel with this thing very often. At school I sometimes even abuse my watch in front of my friends by slapping it on the table with full force to show them that they DO NOT wanna get slapped by this thing (it's just a joke; I would never hurt anyone unless there is very good reason since I'm pretty passive, but they're now aware I have a makeshift weapon with me at all times). I went to Cambodia last summer for a whole month, taking it across the ocean with me, swam in saltwater with it, and traveled most of the country. Surprisingly the airport security all 8 times said nothing about my watch, as it is related to being the official Al-Qaeda watch... something which is a fun fact to tell people.This thing is *still* going strong. It's clear as day to read, with very minor scratches on the face of it. The scratches are not even noticeable at 2 feet away from my eyes (even after the abuse)! The light it has is very long lasting as well, and is bright enough that you can use it as a very makeshift flashlight for things that are very close to you by facing the light away from you and pressing the button for it. It has helped me find light switches in the dark many of times.For settings things, it's very very easy. You may only need to look at the manual probably 2-5 times before you remember everything necessary because it's just so simple. If any buttons are broken it's a pretty simple fix as well; here's what I did: 1a.) Unscrew the thing on the back if you have the right kind of screws. If not, look for them on Amazon. They are I think a -2 Phillips. 1b.) Take out the screws very carefully and put them somewhere they won't be lost. They are very small, hard to handle, and easy to lose. 2.) Gently take out the rubber thing that covers the internal edges. Feel around if you don't see it right away, you will eventually. 3.) Grab a pair of small scissors, meaning the tips of the blade can fit into a small space. 4.) In the watch there are Signal Connectors, which look like small arms coming from the middle edges of the actual machine. 5.) Simply bend them perhaps 45 degrees toward the actual machine using the scissors as pliers. Make sure the button does not lay under or over the Signal Connector, only to the side of it where it can be pressed. 6a.) Repeatedly press the button time to time to test if the function of the button is restored. 6b.) Adjust the angle in step 5 as necessary. You want to bend the Connector to the point it doesn't always touch the Receiver (the thing that actually performs the function of each button), or you will have a frozen watch. 7.) When the button finally works again after some toying around, put the rubber thing back in, pressing every corner back into place, and then screw the case back into place very tightly. 8.) Drop the watch in water before you wear it to ensure you won't get electrocuted.The alarm has gotten me up most of the times, and I'm not a light sleeper. Although I'm also nowhere near a heavy one. The inaccuracy can seriously vary... once it was off by a minute in a week. This week it is only off by about 7 seconds. Really, just sync it weekly and you should be fine. The watch is very good if you just need a very good idea of what the time is.Thanks for reading! I would definitely recommend this watch and perhaps will buy it again if the dang thing finally breaks!!",

It looks really nice, has all the features you'd need.  I like that it shows the time and the date without having to hit a button.  The light isn't very bright but it's enough to see the display in the dark.  I shower with it every day and it holds up.  Just what I needed and wanted",

When it finally gives out, it's time for a new watch. At that time the wrist strap is about worn. Why bother replacing the battery when new ones are so cheap.There are problems in communities where people are robbed of their Rolexes on the streets. I've had no problems with robbers attempting to cut off my arm for my Casio watch. Even though they don't want it, heads turn when I'm out on the town wearing my Casio.",

The watch performs flawlessly and despite mentions of it being retro, it is slick, modern, and even better looking in person.I will say, however, that I found the included contract unusual and potentially disturbing. When I placed the order, a prompt I\u2019d never seen before appeared, inviting me to read and sign a contract. The document stated rather explicitly that the watch was for \u201chandsome guys\u201d and that I would not be permitted to wear it if I was a \u201cmajor uggo\u201d. Whatever. I signed the contract and placed the order. What happened next was the truly unexpected...Two days after placing the order, I received a knock on my door very late at night. I wish I could tell you what time it was, but I did not yet own the watch so it is impossible to say. I peered through my peephole and saw the figure of a tall man in a long coat. Slowly, I opened the door and asked him what he wanted. It\u2019s then I noticed a wristwatch with the largest band I\u2019d ever seen wrapped around his forehead. It was analog, so I couldn\u2019t tell the time. The man introduced himself in a voice so quiet his words were almost drowned out by the ticking of his pretentious headwatch. \u201cI\u2019m with Casio,\u201d he says. Or maybe \u201cDime sith mass E oh\u201d. Hard to say. Still confused, I asked him again what he wanted. It was then that things took a turn for the worse.Uninvited, he stepped into my home and grabbed my face with his cold, dry, watch-tuning fingers. I tried to resist and found my body unresponsive. I\u2019ve later theorized that his stupid, unreadable headwatch was in some way hypnotic and temporarily robbed me of my senses. By the dim porch light, he jerked my head around, carefully but methodically inspecting every angle of my face. It obviously wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d conducted this sick facial analysis.Suddenly, he stopped. With me still immobile and deathly frightened, he took a step back, gave me one final, fleeting check and muttered \u201cAcceptable. Seven out of ten.\u201d Having said this, he promptly tapped the dial on his gaudy headwatch and I fell to the ground, exhausted and overwhelmed by my experience, but released from his spell.The next thing I knew, it was morning and someone was calling for me. \u201cSir? Sir? Are you okay?\u201d I looked up and saw my door was agape and the mail person stood above me, package in hand. Embarrassed to have been defeated by the mysterious man and his unfashionable watch, I simply nodded and began to stand. Obviously unsettled, the mail person handed me the package as I rose and told me to have a good day. It was my watch! And boy, what a watch it is!The moral of the story is this: the watch is incredible, and at $20 perhaps the finest entry-level watch money can buy.However, potential buyer, I caution you this: if you are any less than a 6.5 or 7 out of 10, don\u2019t kid yourself. Perhaps you\u2019ve got more a F91W or G-Shock type of face, and that\u2019s nothing to feel bad about. Not everyone can be handsome! Just be careful - I\u2019ve heard the watchman and his hideous headwatch do not look kindly upon the unattractive.",

The buttons failed long before the supposed 10 year battery. This one seems better made, and I now appreciate the lightness, and slimness. I knew going in that the backlight is a useless joke, but I chose this over the very similar newer model with a much better light. This one is quite a bit thinner, smaller overall and less flashy. The display seems a bit clearer too. I found the included band to be cheap and awful, and I immediately swapped it out for my old expanding band. Easy on and off, and I barely know it's there. If the buttons last 5 years, I'll be happy...",

This is something like 34mm and fits my narrow wrist perfectly. The stainless band, while thin, should far outlast any of the cheap plastic bands Casio puts on some of their watches.

                    "review": "For the past 10 years, I've thought that mechanical watches had so much charm and passion, while quartz watches were soulless devices. I picked up this watch to be a \"beater\" when my automatic watches weren't suitable, but I've actually grown quite fond of the GW-M5610. What's not to love about a light, small, tough-as-nails, super accurate, solar watch?I got this watch from Amazon on April 5, 2019 (in the USA). First thing I noticed was that it did not come in the hexagonal tin box that a lot of older online reviews show, but a flimsy cardboard box with a simple display holder. At first I was annoyed, but honestly the box would have just been tucked away in storage with other watch boxes that never see any use.After unboxing, you'll find a warranty card, a handful of manuals in various languages, and the watch in a simple plastic bag (no protective stickers on the crystal or caseback, no fancy hangtags). I immediately checked out when the last sync time was (bottom right button), which happened to be on November 1. Assuming this sync happened before it was packaged up, that meant it was sitting for 5 months in the dark, but it still showed high power (as indicated at the bottom of the display, where there's a L, M, H meter). Yay for power saving mode!Next step was to set the timezone. The manual states that the default timezone after losing all power is Tokyo. I assumed this was what the watch would be shipped with, but mine was set to NYC by default. I'm curious if watches sent to the USA are set this way, or if someone played around with this watch. After selecting my local timezone (Pacific), it was only 2 seconds slow! I know quartz watches are accurate but that is phenomenal, especially considering the manual states +/- 15 seconds per month without a signal calibration.Speaking of signal calibration, I've had my watch automatically sync about every other night in Seattle. I have an old Casio Waveceptor (10 years old) that never syncs anymore. I don't know if that's because it has become defective, or the GW-M5610 can pick up a weaker signal strength. Regardless, there's no need to worry about missing a few nights in a row of syncing, as it'll still be very accurate.The caseback on mine was machined and not stamped, with crisp engraving (FYI, I removed the serial number from the image, normally found on the bottom of the caseback). As far as I know, only older models will have the stamped, rounded version. While on the wrist, it feels just as comfortable as any rounded caseback I've had.I really like that the resin strap is already pre-rounded/pre-shaped. I've had tough, flat rubber/plastic/resin straps on other watches that were incredibly uncomfortable (I'm looking at you, SKX009). On my 6.25\" wrist, the watch strap keeper is right at the end, and there's maybe 1/4\" excess strap sticking out. If your wrist is smaller, you'll unfortunately have more strap sticking out, which will probably be a bit annoying.Other reviews state that the A-EL feature didn't work on their watches, which is the auto-illumination when you tilt your wrist up. Mine works flawlessly. I'm curious if this was an issue with earlier models that has since been addressed.The only minor annoyance I can find with this watch is the non-standard lug width/strap. I think the stock strap fits it perfectly (both in terms of comfort and aesthetics) and have no desire to change it, but it's proprietary. That being said, I'm sure it won't be hard to find a replacement strap if needed.The GW-M5610 has a perfect blend of retro styling, useful functions, durability, comfort, and laziness (it sets itself!).",

                    "review": "I know some may grill me for purchasing this G Shock instead of an Apple Watch but honestly I don't regret it at all.  Some day I may get an Apple Watch like the rest of the human population but there were a couple of things that drew me to the G Shock instead.  First and foremost is that its meant for wearing all day long regardless of setting.  You can wear while taking a shower or excercising or doing yard work.  I wore this watch while doing menial yard work over the wknd and didnt have a worry that I was getting dirt and grass on it or it was banging against trees and branches.  This thing is G Shock indestructible!  I also liked that the watch has a basic design packed with a ton of features like solar power, auto sync with atomic clock, and all the other standard digital watch features and the size is just right.  I have smaller wrists and it fits perfect.  Even though its made from a resin plastic, its lightweight and you forget that you are wearing it.  Finally, the price is right vs the more expensive Apple Watch.  Only two minor negatives that I can think of which are not big enough for me to downgrade the rating is, its a utilitarian type of watch and so if you like wearing nicer watches to a professional or upscale environment, this is not the watch to wear and the other is the atomic clock sync.  I find for me personally that I have to place my watch against the window sill before I go to bed to sync.  I think it syncs automatically at midnight or maybe 1am.  Otherwise it will not sync if you place it on the dresser or desk indoors away from a window.  I've been wearing this watch every day since I purchased it so thats a reason I gave it 5 stars.",

I\u2019m more of a mechanical watch guy, and this was my first g shock I\u2019ve purchased since I was maybe 10 years old. For the $91 I paid it has so many features and is very durable and comfortable on the wrist. It\u2019s extremely accurate as well. The ONLY complaint I have is the radio signal it uses for the atomic time adjustments at 12am-5am are sometimes not good. If I lived in a very busy urban area, I wouldn\u2019t be able to get much signal to the nearest radio tower to get the atomic function to work daily. With that being said, it remains very accurate and you really only need the feature to update once a month or so to keep great time. You also have the option to activate the atomic time whenever you get in good signal somewhere so it\u2019s not a huge deal. If you\u2019re on the fence about purchasing one, just get it.",

                    "review": "The direct descendent of the original Casio G-Shock that was released in 1983 is the GW-5000, which is available as an import from Japan.  This GW-M5610 is a first cousin of that pricier watch and it carries on the tradition of tough square G-Shocks.  What you lose from the GW-5000 is the stainless steel case with a screwed-down back whereas the GW-M5610 has a resin case with a stainless steel back plate held down with four screws.  Both watches have identical features including solar charging, atomic time synchronization, World Time, four daily alarms with snooze function, a countdown timer, a stopwatch, and electroluminescent illumination that can be automatically engaged with the movement of your wrist in a dark environment.  The GW-M5610 gets a red surround and white, blue, and yellow writing on the face which makes it a little busier aesthetically than more monochromatic versions of the 5000 and 5600 series.The first thing I noticed about the watch is how much smaller, thinner, and lighter it is compared to round G-Shock versions I own.  It is an excellent choice to wear under long sleeves and jackets because it easily fits underneath them with minimal interference.  I will be using this watch in the winter months for daily wear due to its sleek profile.  The second thing of note is the crisp clarity of the numbers in the positive LCD screen.  It surpasses my Casio Pro-Trek PRW-3500 in regards to off-axis legibility even though the Pro-Trek\u2019s digits are 50% larger than the GW-M5610\u2019s.  I am really impressed with how good this watch\u2019s display is.I find the strap fits comfortably on my 7-1/2 inch wrist.  The light weight makes me forget that I am even wearing a watch at all.  Contrary to the dozens of complaints from previous owners here on Amazon, my auto backlight function works perfectly fine even though I leave it shut off in order to conserve power.  My watch was manufactured on January 8, 2015 so maybe Casio has finally fixed the issue with faulty backlight switches.  There are several one star reviews of this watch here because of this issue and I honestly cannot understand how one can downgrade the rating of the entire watch due to one feature that most G-Shock users end up turning off anyway.  The auto backlight duration unfortunately is not adjustable like my Pro-Trek and Gulfmaster.  I would prefer the ability to lengthen it from 1 second to 3, but this is a minor nit.The function buttons are all recessed into a protective niche on the side of the case so pressing them only works for me when I use the tip of a fingernail.  Action is positive and appropriate for the pressing force I apply.  The World Time, stop watch, and timer functions all work like other Casio digital watches and are intuitively accessed with mode button.  The one complaint I do have is that the volume of the alarm signal is very weak and probably would not wake a person from a deep sleep.  If Amazon\u2019s star rating system would allow it, I would subtract a half star for this and would suggest not relying on this watch for important wake-ups and instead using the alarm from dedicated alarm clock or smart phone.  Note that this isn\u2019t any different than the other Casio solar-charged watches, so it may be a function of reduced battery capacity.My watch arrived from Amazon with the power reserve showing at the Medium level.  I put it out in the sun for about 30 minutes and the reading went to High.  I set my home city, clicked Daylight Savings Time to the automatic setting, and synched the watch to the atomic clock signal in Ft. Collins without any trouble.  Each evening just after midnight it synchs automatically so the watch always has an accurate time reading.  I\u2019ve had no issues with not receiving the signal but then again I live in a state bordering Colorado and all my atomic watches synch each day without fail.This watch is a great heir to the spirit of the original G-Shock.  It wears small and comfortably on the wrist, is tough as nails, cost about one-third of what the GW-5000 does, has the accuracy of atomic synching, should run for a decade or more on the original solar battery (note that all solar watches will need to have the rechargeable battery replaced as some time in their lives), and has a very clear and legible display.As a long-time G-Shock owner, I have previously been drawn to only the round case models.  I find it remarkable that after finally taking the plunge with this square case GW-M5610 that I have been absolutely delighted by this watch.  It\u2019s certainly not very flashy and has a nerdy charm of its own.  No one in going to compliment you on it, but that\u2019s all part of the fun of being a G-Shock fan.  I now regret taking so long to come around to the Square Side and can recommend this watch most highly.",

                    "review": "So - I wore a DW6600 for years and years until it finally got stolen a few months ago. I figured I'd just do what I did last time I lost my original 6600 over 10 years ago - go buy a New Old Stock one on eBay or Amazon. Well lo and behold, it turn out that Bradley friggin Cooper ruined that for me by prominently wearing one in \"American Sniper\"... Now all of a sudden a NOS 6600 was selling for over $200.Well screw that. I loved the 6600 but truthfully I often felt it was too big and it hurt my hand when I bent my wrist back. So I decided to see what else there was - and was delighted to find that Casio had re-released the original 5600.In the course of my browsing I also saw the 5610 and was interested to see how the two might compare.So I purchased both - and of the two and I ended up keeping the 5610.Here, briefly is why...This one has simplicity on its side - there are only the 4 traditional modes: Time, Alarm, Stopwatch, and Timer.The 5610 by contrast has another mode - a 2nd time mode that appears on the first click through the modes. This mode tells you the time in one of any of the other time zones in the world, and as far as I'm concerned this is a completely useless feature... I suppose if you are one of those people that always needs to know what time it is in Hong Kong and can't seem to remember how to add or subtract then this is great. Otherwise it's just a useless extra step I have to go through to get to the other modes.It's a small thing but it annoys me and so I consider this another mark in the 5600's favor.Another thing that stands out on the 5600 vs the 5610 is the length of time the EL stays lit. The 5600 stays illuminated for just over 2 seconds, the 5610 for maybe just 1.5 seconds - it maybe seem like a tiny difference but it is noticeable, noticeable enough that when I first got my 5610 I was annoyed by it.And lastly - the 5610 flashes it's EL when an alarm goes off. This is actually a pretty useful feature for me since I often work in noisy and dark circumstances.So why then did I decide on the 5610?Well - the 5610 has 4 alarms, which comes in handy for me.The build quality just feels way better to me.The numerals are larger.The screen is brighter - I mean even without the EL.It never has to have the time set - Atomic clock sync takes care of that.It is solar powered so will never need a battery replacement.It looks nicer (to me) with the red accents around the face.It's more flexible setting alarms and timers since you can go both up and down if you accidentally go past your alarm time (the 5610 only goes up).But the BIGGEST hit against the 5600 is this: the damn ADJUST button is SO recessed into the case that I can't even activate it with my fingers. Now granted I have big fingers and no nails, but that is probably true for a lot of guys who might buy this watch. And the fact that I need a friggin' toothpick or paperclip or a pen to press and hold it down is really a total deal killer. Both my old 6600 and the 5610 have a recessed button that can't be activated accidentally, but both can be easily activated by me despite my big fat fingers.So in the end I decided to spend the extra $40* and keep the 5610 and I'm pretty happy so far...It would get 5 stars except for the two big things that bug me - the useless 2nd time mode and the too-brief EL illumination.*Note that the price difference seems to have gotten bigger since just a few weeks ago - it is now $60 which is pretty significant.",

                    "review": "The order shows Casio G-Shock GWM5610-1, but the watch back shows GW-M5610U.  Sold by Amazon.  Sold as new and received in new condition.SUMMARY:  I have given the watch a rating of 5 because it does what is stated in the manual (qw3495.pdf, on the Casio site).  The watch is not entirely satisfactory for me; I assumed more alarm capability than this watch has.PRO:  Shock and water resistant.  Light button recessed.  Solar power.  Time setting automatic.  Resin band comfortable and easy to clean.  Watch has 5 alarms.CON:  Watch could snag on things.  Numerous button presses may be required for settings.  Gaskets should be replaced every 2-3 years.  Significant unobstructed bright-light time needed to keep the battery charged.  Alarms daily only; cannot be set for a specific date.  Band durability uncertain.Shape and Appearance:  The watch face looks nice and practical.  The watch is rather wide.  The watch is thick, but the design makes the thickness less noticeable.  The watch is large and somewhat angular, so it could snag on things.  The width, thickness, and angularity probably improve shock absorption.Buttons:  The buttons are slightly recessed, which is good.(I want to conserve battery power, so I don't want to turn on the light accidentally, for example while putting on clothing or putting my hand in a pocket.)Because the watch has only 4 buttons, entering settings and alarm times can require a number of button presses.(I previously owned Casio calculator/databank/alarm watches that use 8 buttons to control settings, including the reverse, forward, 0, and PM buttons, and use the numeric keypad for setting times and dates.)Water Resistance:  Having only 4 buttons makes water resistance more practical.  The gaskets are supposed to be replaced every 2-3 years, maybe by an authorized CASIO service center.(I doubt that I will bother to have the gaskets replaced.  My Casio calculator/databank/alarm watches have not been water resistant, presumably because of their numeric keypads.  My most recent DBC-32 watch probably stopped working after 7 years because I had washed the watch many times -- my mistake.)Solar power:  Powering the solar cells requires a lot of bright-light time, from my point of view.  When the watch is charging, no part of the watch face should be covered, for example, by a shirt sleeve.(I usually don't spend a lot of time outdoors, so I occasionally prop the watch on a windowsill, with the help of the plastic stand on which the watch is shipped.  The solar cell requirements are detailed in the manual.)Band:  I think the resin band is comfortable, and it stays clean.  Metal straps would yank on my arm hairs.  Unbuckling the wrist strap is easier because the metal prong has enough weight and free motion that the prong can fall out of the way when it is pulled out of a hole in the strap.  The manual says that the strap should be fastened loosely enough that you can insert a finger under the strap, but photos show that many users fasten their straps tightly.  The keeper (the resin loop that holds the free end of one strap against the other strap) contains a cutout slot.  When I slide the keeper over the free end, it sometimes snags on that slot.  I hope that Casio will remove the slot or make it short enough to prevent snagging.(I have used Casio watches for 40 years.  The resin straps have broken on the majority of those watches.  I have been careful to limit bending and pulling on the straps of my most recent calculator/databank/alarm watch, especially when putting the watch on and taking it off, so there is no sign of cracking after 7 years.  I cut off most of the bump on the free end of the strap, to reduce stress on the keeper.  I don't know if Casio has improved the band durability.  I think the bands ideally would consist of nylon or Kevlar fibers running lengthwise, covered by resin.)Alarms:  Although the watch has 5 alarms, I can specify only hours and minutes, not months and days.  In other words, the watch only has daily alarms, not yearly alarms.(I need to be able to set each alarm for any particular minute during the next year.  Again, I should have read the manual before buying.)Automatic Time Setting:  This feature works for me; it is impressive.  After automatic time setting, any discrepancy  between the watch time and time.gov appears to be less than 0.1 second.",

Now I look at them again \"M\" - but this is understandable, not the season, however, there is not enough sun and clothes with long sleeves.  Yes, and I use it to the maximum - auto-backlight, attempts at manual synchronization, alarms, auto-synchronization ... I'll try to leave it on the windowsill for the whole weekend - maybe it will stop throwing them from \"H\" to \"M\" and vice versa.By synchronization:Synchronized without any problems via smartphone.  The application is called \"DCF77 Emulator\".Compulsory synchronization or auto-night synchronization with towers has not been successful yet.  Finding out how much they are in a hurry or lagging behind in a month - I have not yet dealt with it, too little time has passed after receiving it.By subject:The clock arrived made in Taiwan.  I do not know why, but subjectively pleased more than Made in China.  There are no scratches, dents, abrasions on the glass, everything is perfect.  The mechanism itself stands in the case evenly, without distortions.  The back cover has no scratches or abrasions, the bumper to the body in the area of \u200b\u200bthe buttons (and, in principle, around the perimeter in general) adjoins very tightly, there are no gaps from the word absolutely.  The end of the strap at the end (where the rounding is) without roughness and burrs - judging by the shiny small thin strip, it was processed with a laser or something hot, yes, I am a \"little\" perfectionist.  The viewing angles are excellent, so that you can somehow look at the watch - so that at first glance the information on the dial is not clear - you need to seriously twist your hand ... I do not feel absolutely problems with the date \"month / day or day / month\"  I am quite comfortable with the existing format - if I could switch the format, I would switch to the existing one.I did not carry out tests with a piece of ice on the dial - then there is no ice, then I forget.Impression for quality and build:First, and in principle, and subsequent impressions - if I chose \"live\" from many in the store - I would have chosen the same copy.  Yes, and not the first and I hope not the last I have CASIO, there have never been problems with the quality.  Live, as I will repeat the opinion of many - they really look better than in the photo, the photo does not convey them at all, I do not know what to call it - an aura?  Charm?Cons: Weight.  After CASIO efa-121d-1a weighing 150+ grams and even on a strap and not on a bracelet, this watch is absolutely not felt on the wrist.  An unusual and not logical arrangement of the backlight button - at night, when I sleep, I always first press two protruding strips just above the button.  The strap is a little harsh.  Silent alarm clock - more precisely, it is not loud but sharp, shrill, and the repeat mode will probably really save if anything.  So far, it wakes up normally - but again, there are not enough statistics.But all these minuses, as it seems to me, are \"habit problems\".  In a couple of weeks it will be finally clear.Just in case, watch tests:Display testCASIO G-SHOCK TEST DISPLAYThis can help you determine if there is any damage to a particular display function that could prevent you from knowing if it is activated or not.  It's also a handy way to see all the hidden display features built into your watch.To enter the display diagnostic mode: \u2022 In timekeeping mode, press buttons (A), (C) and (D) at the same time. \u2022 All display segments are activated. \u2022 Press (D) to view display test modes. \u2022 The last screen will show the Casio module number \u2022 Press any button to return to normal modeCASIO G-SHOCK TILT SENSOR DIAGNOSTIC MODEAll Casio auto-illuminated models use a basic tilt sensor to determine the position of the dial.  If you are having problems with Auto-EL, you may have a faulty tilt sensor.  Fortunately, Casio engineers have built in a tilt sensor diagnostic mode that can be used to diagnose potential problems.To access the tilt sensor diagnostics screen: \u2022 In timekeeping mode, press buttons (A), (B) and (C) at the same time. \u2022 TLT is displayed on the screen \u2022 The display will show \u201c8888\u201d when the sensor is activated. \u2022 Press any button to return to normal modeSolar Panel TestCASIO G-SHOCK SOLAR SENSOR DIAGNOSTIC MODEThe Rigid Solar G-Shock models use dedicated batteries and a set of small solar panels to maintain a charge.  If you're having trouble charging your watch even in direct sunlight, you may have damaged your solar panels.  To check the health of your solar panels, you can use the built-in solar diagnostic mode. ________________________________________To access the solar diagnostic screen: \u2022 In timekeeping mode, press buttons (A), (B) and (D) at the same time. \u2022 SLR is displayed on the screen \u2022 The display will show \u201c8888\u201d when the solar cell is receiving light. \u2022 Press any button to return to normal modeIf the battery is fully charged, solar panels may not receive additional sunlight.CASIO G-SHOCK ENERGY SAVINGAnother great feature hidden in the Casio G-Shock manual is the ability to automatically conserve power when not in use.  The power saving function will automatically turn off the display after 60-70 minutes of inactivity.  In this sleep mode, all other watch functions (including alarm and radio sync) remain active.  After 6 or 7 days of inactivity, the watch will enter deep sleep mode, which will disable automatic reception, beeps, tones, backlight and display. ________________________________________To turn on power saving mode: \u2022 In timekeeping mode, press and hold button (A) until the area code flashes. \u2022 Press (C) nine times until the power setting screen appears (PS is displayed). \u2022 Press (D) to turn on or off \u2022 Press (A) again to install and exitG-SHOCK AUTO LIGHT MODE ONThis is probably one of the more well-known hidden features of the Casio G-Shock, but still one that many people are not aware of.  Most G-Shocks with a backlight function actually have an \u201cauto-backlight\u201d mode, a great feature that automatically lights up the watch when it's tilted 15 degrees towards your face.  While this feature is known to drain the battery faster, it is smart enough to shut down if the watch goes below full charge.  In addition, the feature will only remain active for six hours before having to manually reactivate it.To turn on auto light: \u2022 Hold button (B) for 3 seconds. \u2022 The wording \u201cA.  El 'will appear on the dial if successful. \u2022 Press and hold the button (B) for 3 seconds to manually shut off, otherwise it will automatically shut off after 6 hours.I'm not attaching a photo yet, there are so many of them  ;)",

                    "review": "This is perhaps as close to a perfect digital watch as you can get.  Besides the toughness of a G=Shock, it's got all the daily features one may need (alarm - which you can set up to 5, stopwatch and countdown timer).  It also has world time, which is a nice feature to have when travelling.  When in stop watch and time modes, the current time is displayed in the upper right corner of the display where the date normally is.  It's solar powered, and the display shows how much power the watch has.  Multi-band 6 is another feature, so it automatically sets the time once it receives a signal from an atomic clock transmitter.  YMMV with this feature though.  I have difficulty receiving the signal being on the U.S. east coast (the transmitter is in Colorado).  There are phone apps you can use to strengthen the signal if normal reception fails.  Despite this, it can be manually set if needed.Visibility of the display is an upgrade over the DW-5600.  It's more clear, and more visible at different viewing angles.  The standard backlight is now LED instead of the classic electroluminescence.  Some prefer the latter.  This may or may not be a deal breaker based on personal preference, but considering what this watch has to offer, it should only be a consideration in the bigger picture.The watch offers a great fit for G-Shock.  With its slim profile, it lacks the bulk of many of the other G-Shock models out there.  It's very comfortable to wear on different size wrists, though the strap may not be everyone's cup of tea.The design is very much retro, harkening back to the 1983 original square with the red border.For the price of this watch, it really is a great value.  It's also possibly the only digital watch you'll ever need unless you want other functions like tides, barometers, etc.  In my collection, this watch is one of my favorites. There's a good chance it will become one of yours too.",

                    "review": "I first bought the lighter model (5600E) to test size and feel of square gshock to have a week end watch to go to the pool, beach or do some handy work without worries since that model can be found under 50 bucks but I ended loving it and thinking it would be perfect if it was at least solar powered so I sold the \u201cregular\u201d one and looked for the same size and shape but with solar option.I looked also for price for the solar option and after some browsing in Amazon (better prices that official website of maker) ended with two options, the 5600U and 5610 with very similar price. Model 5610 features previous module but in my opinion a better illumination.I read in many reviews that model 5610 was not available and even if offered you could en up receiving newer 5610U model with improved functionality with language settings for day format, hour on timer and stop watch and updated time zones and world time features so I made the purchase based on price and open to the possibility of any of the 2 models 5610 or 5610U.I ended up receiving the newer version and loved it. Much better than 5600 with same look and feel. LED light is not as nice as EL light in previous model but it\u2019s not bad at all. Newer functionality is a much welcomed update.Really recommend this watch for any occasion and all purposes. A watch with great history and personality and this is the best price I found online. Other options available for this model offer other colors, collaborations and special releases but with higher prices (20%+) so if like me you like the classic look closer to the original g-shock that started it all over 40 years ago, this is it.",

It is well built, I love the bracelet itself. I also love the design language of the dial. The movement of this watch is unbelievable. For a big watch, it is not so heavy, at least not in my opinion. In fact, it is quite comfortable to wear. The only complaint I have well 2 complaints that I have is one I wish the dial screen was made of sapphire crystal and I wish the watch was a solar charged or kinetic energy charged watch instead of a regular 3 plus year battery. Outside of that, this watch as I said earlier is definitely worth the price and I truly am loving this watch.",

The bracelet is chunky, although detailed with a combination of brushed and polished finishes, with the Bulova logo, however I found it to be a little brash and ungainly. I promptly substituted it with a 24mm NATO strap natostrapco.com and now the watch looks proportional and easier on the wrist.This inner details of the watch face are spectacular; the carbon fiber is industrial, the \"engraved\" steel ring connecting all the hour markings and the blue/cobalt ring that only reflects when light shines on it. The crystal has a complex curve on it and this is the only watch I have seen that has such a curve on it. The outer ring on the face is raised and has the tachymeter markings as well. The non rotating bezel is polished and has black engraved markings such as diver 60 min markings; the side of the bezel is also textured and 4 hex screws holding everything together. The case is large and tall, with a dual brushed and polished steel finish. The 3 push buttons are polished and the screw down crown has an engraved Bulova logo, it is has an engraved angled gear patten for handling and is protected with crown guards on either side.Now down to the mechanics, in a word its fabulous. The stop watch in motion is absolutely gorgeous to look and the primary driving force behind the purchase of this watch. The smooth motion of the large second's hand is sublime and the added infinity symbol of the precisionist line is a nice touch. The transition from normal mode to the stopwatch function and back again is nice to see as it moves faster to move to the 12 o'clock position to zero the stop watch and then rushes to catch up to the current time once switching back from the stopwatch to the normal mode.Then there are the sub-dials; top most displaying two needle hands measuring 10th and 100th of a second, left one measuring the minutes, the right one measuring the hours and the bottom most the 1000th of a second, while the large second's hand, doing its thing measuring the seconds. The hour and minute's hands are hollow broad sword style hands, with luminous markings on the tips (luminous markings are on each hour marking as well, however that is one downside to this watch, not at all bright and frankly a bit poor, however not a deal breaker for me).This watch is great and a lot going for it, the size may deter a few people, but replacing the bracelet with a leather/Ballistics Nylon or NATO / ZULU strap changes the characteristics of the watch and reduces the acreage it occupies on your wrist. In is a good way, by reducing the BLING factor of this watch, not something that I was going for. It looks more understated and you will blind fewer pilots and thus make the skies a safer place... which is a real public service.SSSSSOOOOOO....UPs are...- Great watch- Awesome movement- Great detail and finishDOWNs are...- Brash bracelet (decided to replace it with a 24mm ballistics nylon NATO from natostrapco.com)- Large / heavy (may apply to individuals with slimmer wrists, but on my 7\" wrist looks great once the bracelet was removed)- Luminous markings are not too bright (not a deal breaker at all)",

It kind of feels like a $2,000 - $2,500 watch. It looks really good with a white gold chain. If you like/enjoy attention, this watch is for you. Precision: The watch has not lost a single second since I bought it. Its precision is somewhat shocking. It beats all my watches, which lose or gain onw or two seconds a month. That is to say, the accuracy of this watch is competing with a smartphone. I'm impressed. Size: If you are a fan of sissy watches, this watch is not for you. Personally, I'm not a fan of small watches. Small watches are too \"effeminate\" for my taste. So, if you have a small wrist, this watch will look like your older brother's watch on your wrist.",

I did countless hours of research before settling on this watch. What initially attracted me to this was the very smooth sweeping second hand. I assure you after about 6 months of constant wear as a \"beater\", the movement appears to be holding true to the accuracy claim. I measured the accuracy against time.gov. The second hand is cruising smooth and cool. It has kept perfect time for me without gaining or losing so much as a second. I just adjusted it for daylight savings and I trust it can be relied upon for accuracy year round.The overall presentation of the watch is stellar. The watch is big and serious. As an engineer, this watch tells people to calm the heck down because I know what I am talking about. The heavy steel bracelet and case have remained looking great even while collecting some dings and scratches. The bracelet is strong and the clasp is sturdy, albeit scratched. However, The 4 hex case screws and the space between the bezel and the case tend to collect a lot of grime and are difficult to clean. My arms are more muscular than average and I think this big monster helps accentuate my physique.I have conked my wife with this thing and the hex screws have scraped her. Sometimes it's hard to find a comfortable position at night with this on my wrist. This beast is no joke.The WindowI was worried that the non-sapphire window would scratch. This has not happened at all and the window is 100% free of scratches. However the window is curved and can make the face difficult to see at non-direct angles because the image of the face becomes warped. The window is also very reflective, which I personally find to be the greatest drawback of this watch from a presentation perspective, and because of the curve, I often am blasted with reflected ceiling lighting or sun before finding the right angle for viewing the face.The FaceIf you are bothering to read this, I do not need to sell you on the face of the watch. It looks exceptional. However I will warn you about a couple things. The luminescence is quite weak and the watch is difficult to read in darkness. Tragically, the minutes gauge on the chrono is too cluttered and small to read effectively. The small minutes gauge might be a deal breaker for real chronograph users because the minute gauge is a pretty important gauge. It would have been more useful to swap the placement of the 1/1000 gauge with the minute gauge when this watch was designed. I was hoping to be able to make more use out of the chronograph but due to the tiny minute gauge, I have not used the chronograph very much.The ChronographThe Chrono is fun to use. The buttons feel sturdy and everything functions. When starting the chrono, the second hand moves quickly into the 12 o clock position and then ticks (rather than sweeps) steadily. When stopping the chrono, the second hand resumes measuring real-world time. Cool! It is possible to pause and resume a chrono measurement.There is a gauge for measuring to the tenth and hundredth of a second which seems to be (sadly) a tad slow but I have not attempted to measure/calibrate it in any scientific way. Also, the 1/10 and 1/100 gauge stops moving after 30 seconds but provides a readout after the chono is stopped. For the first 30 seconds and for 30 seconds after resuming a chronograph measurement I am mesmerized by those tiny hands whirring around with high accuracy at such an incredible rate.The 1/1000 gauge does not move until the chronograph is stopped. So, it supposedly provides a final reading of the measurement to the precision of one one-thousandth of a second. The 1/1000 gauge is fun, but get real, there is no way anyone would ever use this or check it for accuracy without a robot. The human reaction time needed to depress the stop/start button totally negates any real usefulness of the 1/1000 gauge (or even 1/100 for that matter). I seriously question the 1/1000 gauge accuracy and challenge it's prominent placement on the face. Still, 1/1000 is kinda neat.The crown/water resistanceAdjusting the time and date feels crisp and satisfying, both via the crown. There appears to be no issue with leakage or water submersion. I have not taken the watch diving, but showering and swimming is not a problem.ThanksI have enjoyed wearing this watch over the past 6 months. I hope the details of this review help someone make a decision one way or the other on this watch. I am afraid I have been bitten by the horology bug. I will be transitioning to a much different watch for a while... a Marathon GSAR automatic.",

Thankfully found this BEAUTIFUL Bulova! Absolutely beautiful time piece! My new favorite. The brushed and polished stainless steel, large case, crystal and bezel, carbon fiber dial and sweeping second hand dial are absolutely just stunning. The size of the watch is perfect. As masculine a watch as you're going to get without being ridiculously over the top. The weight is perfect as well. Heavy enough to remind you that this is a quality piece. Feels like a gauntlet. This watch commands attention and admiration! People who see it stare at it. Very easy to size the bracelet w/ the correct tools and setting the time was easy using just the crown (unlike certain Citizen pieces). After sizing and setting time, I buffed and polished  the case and bracelet and she shined brilliantly. Price was PERFECT and was even able to do Amazon interest free monthly pmt plan. Shipping was a fast 2 DAYS. Purchased Monday and received Wednesday. Didn't have to go anywhere to find my new favorite piece. Amazon is the absolute KING of retail. I've owned the 2-Tone (stainless/yellow gold) Blue Submariner Rolex which I absolutely loved. This Bulova piece is every bit as impressive without the hefty price tag. Plus it's an American brand since 1875.",

                    "review": "For the price, this is amazing!To get it out of the way, there is ONE niggle: I woud rather have a bright white coat on the pointers, than the neon-green \"lume\" paint. \"lume\" in modern watches is nothing but a gimmick, as the original lume coats in the first half of the 20th century were radio-active! We don't have those anymore, so modern lume only glows, when a watch is \"charged\" in bright light, and it only lasts a minute or two, so is totally useless and dark at night.Otherwise, this Invicta is a lovely watch, both tough and dressy (which is almost impossible) and maybe my favourite ever, after I wore many designer watches, like Skagen, and many tough daily beaters, with so far nothing more accurate and reliable and tough than a Casio, believe it or not.Growing up with the first quartz watches, I never even looked at mechanical watches until now. The Seiko movement in these Invictas is within 15 seconds or so in a day, so it is easy to live with, as far as accuracy is concerned, so it is good enough not just for a retired guy, like myself!The dial is very easy and a joy to read with this black dial and white(ish) hand hand theme. The picture of the Pro Diver on my wrist was made in a dimly lit room and it only gets better in better light.This stainless steel and black bezel model is a beautiful watch, with the heft of about 150 grams or 5 ounces for both watch and the very solid and smooth steel band, but surprisingly comfortable to wear all day!Is it a Rolex? No. Is it as good? Yes, not just for the money, and I find it in far better taste than wasting big money on a Rolex, even if I had that much :)In trade for not ever needing a new battery again, I was expecting a so-so accurate watch, within maybe -20 to +40 seconds per day as specified for the NH35A movement by Seiko, that is inside. Depending on how it is worn and stored at night (mine needs to go face down to slow down a bit, after running ahead a wee bit all day), it actually stays well within 15 seconds/day, and I only adjust it twice a week now. This is totally remarkable for such a seriously affordable mechanical watch (paid WAY under 80 bucks for this one).Only my lesser quartz watches are this good (it only gets better with a real Casio!), so for a purely mechanical watch, it is simply outstanding!I checked this one with a timegrapher (free app for phone is available, or you can buy a physical one), and in the different positions (face up/down, 12 up, 6 up, 3 up, 9 up), it is either a few seconds per day fast or slow, always within 12 seconds per day, so with daily wear, where your hand changes position all the time, it averages out to just about perfect.Fit and finish are very good, and I would have no complaints if this were a 500 dollar watch, but for way under 100 bucks, this is a beautiful gift from the makers! The design is  of course nothing new, and even the 1953 Rolex Submariner this is paying homage to, was a design evolution rather than a completely a new design, if you pay attention to really old movies. So those who hate this Invicta as a Submariner copy, can get lost :) All I know is, that to buy a new Rolex, I would have to order one on a waiting list and spend at bare minimum what 200 or more of these little Invicta marvels would cost, and even more with extras, like the date wheel that is included here!This one looks simply great and fits into any environment, whether you actually use it as a dive watch (many people do, just read reviews all over the web), or with a suit at a posh dinner party!A word about being waterproof:You HAVE to screw down the crown! If you see a gap between the crown and the case, the crown is open, and if the watch fills with water, it is YOUR fault! This will happen on any dive watch with a screw-down crown, if you do not pay attention, so those who wrote bad reviews somewhere about these watches leaking, did not pay attention. There is a whole video about that subject on Youtube as well.I am a retired and stroke disabled guy with heart problems, so I'd be nuts to dive in anything deeper than a bathtub, but I am confident this is every-day water-proof after taking a few showers with it :)OH yes, the bezel - it rotates anti-clockwise only. It is very stiff and hard to rotate, tough to use for old and partially paralyzed hands like mine, but it clicks nicely into place at 2 clicks per minute marker. The fact it is so hard to rotate also means it is good for the job at hand, because it stays where you set it! When you set it with \"0\" to where the minute hand is at this time, it is an optical aid to start counting minutes, which is important for divers with air tanks! This is from the days before calculators and digital watches, just like slide rules. You could try to remember when you started, but in physical stress situations and going through temperature and pressure extremes, which I have been in as a veteran, the mind can get very foggy, so a simple display of simple and important information is crucial for survival. Once set, push the bezel clockwise to seat it with at most a tiny slip into the last click-stop, and it lines up perfectly, being a real precision piece!Altogether, LOVE it!",

                    "review": "Frankly, I was somewhat skeptical. A decent, let alone good, watch at this price from ... ahem ... Invicta? Well, my experience 2 weeks or so into ownership has pretty much proven my suspicions to be ill-founded. This is a terrific watch, made all the better because of the \"silly\" price. Pay 20x the money or much more, if you want, in terms of a quality watch, you won't do better. OK, it doesn't say Omega or Rolex on the dial. But, let me take you through my likes and dislikes.1. Appearance.It looks terrific straight out of the case and appears to be well made. On my wrist, I think it looks great -- it's 40mm, ie, medium sized these days, and that suits me.2. Feel.It has a surprising heft. I wasn't expecting this for a watch at this price-point, but it feels substantial, but not overly heavy, when wearing it.  I like that very much -- it's reassuring, somehow, and suggests robustness and superior build quality to my way of thinking.3. Durability.Too soon to tell, overall, However, when I accidentally banged the watch against a heavy metal gate the other day, I winced, fully expecting to find at least a cracked or scratched crystal, or damage to the strap. Nope. Nada. I wasn't just relieved, I was, again, very pleasantly surprised by this piece.4. Reliability.Again, probably too early to say, overall. Again, however, I will say this: my watch has been keeping perfect time. Saying so here will now probably jinx it, but we shall see. I was not expecting this from my own prior experience with an automatic watch, and some of the other reviews here. It wouldn't have bothered me too much, as I viewed time gain/loss as part of the automatic watch experience -- and I like to engage with my devices. Sort of like preferring to drive stick over automatic. It's a personal thing. But, so far, this watch has kept perfect time.5. Automatic movement.I just prefer it to quartz, although quartz is, typically, just perfectly accurate. I didn't want to see the word \"quartz\" on the dial, and I liked seeing the watch-movement on the back of the case. That movement, however, is painted yellow, not left stainless. Initially, I was put off by this because I just didn't like the aesthetic. However, I almost never see it as the watch is on my wrist all the time, and now I've become used to it anyway.6. Service.This also really surprised me. I took delivery of the watch and followed the instructions (or so I thought) to set both the time and the date. Problem: time re-set ok, but not the date, no matter how often I tried. I was disappointed and annoyed with myself. After all, at this price-point, what could I expect? So, I waited 24 hours and was advised I could either get a complete refund or a replacement. If io ted for the replacement, i would have 30 days to return the original, or else my card would be charged again. I opted for the replacement, which arrived a few days later. Again, I was unable to set the date, although the setting the time went flawlessly. Again I was frustrated, but also skeptical of the possibility that not one but two watches had the identical issue. Perhaps the problem wasn't with the watch, but with me -- perhaps I was doing something wrong? I took them to a nearby jeweler/Invicta dealer, who showed me that, yes indeed, the problem was me. When setting the date, even though you are going forward, you have to wind backwards, ie, counter-clockwise. Problem solved! I therefore returned the replacement watch and kept the original. Yes, the instructions in the box could have been clearer, but I was mightily impressed by the Seller (Amazon?) immediately sending me a replacement with no questions asked, and then giving me 30 days to return the original before charging my card.7. The\"unboxing\" experience.People post YouTube videos of themselves unboxing their latest doo-dad all the time. Certainly, there is something satisfying about unboxing your new iProduct or Cartier that adds to the whole ownership experience. This, for me, was not that. The box is a horrible vinyl. The yellow color isn't exactly subtle, but would probably look better in cardboard. I don't keep it out anywhere visible. The instructions are stuffed into the lid and don't fit. It all looks and feels wrong. The watch itself was covered in a number of transparent protective tapes, that were tricky to remove and required some patience. All that said, none of these (minor) gripes have affected my overall, very positive experience.8. Value For Money.You could get yourself the quartz version for about $30 cheaper at the time of writing. While that's not nothing, and is about a full one-third less than this watch, I opted for this model. The quartz model also has a slightly different bezel, one which I actually prefer as it's a little more modern and subtle, without the classic, jagged \"teeth.\" This watch has the traditional look. However, for me, an automatic stainless-steel diver's watch with these looks, heft and reliability at this price, represents excellent VFM.9.Conclusion.If you're considering this watch, I say buy it. It's very reasonably priced for what it is and you'll have ample time to return it if you don't like it.",

                    "review": "I figured I'd give it a few months before writing the review so as to provide a more thorough evaluation and contrast it with my other watch experiences.Background (so you can see where I'm coming from):  I bought a Seiko Kinetic when those came out in the late 90s, thinking it was a good long-term watch and I wouldn't have the hassle of a battery- that was the whole point.  Then I discovered the capacitor needed replaced after a few years- about as long as a battery would have lasted and far more expensive- costing a decent chunk of another watch.  It was a sharp and unique looking watch.  The replacement capacitor didn't last but maybe a year and change.Giving up, I then bought a Citizen Ecodrive.  Same thought- no battery to mess with, solar, titanium, day and date.  Nice... till a few years go by (about as long as a battery might last) and it won't hold a charge.  I've had a few battery watches along the way, but finally decided to look for a mechanical.After my experiments with the gimmick watches, I was tired of shelling out way more than a battery change should cost about as often or more frequently than an actual battery watch would require maintenance.  What's the point?  Those should just be battery watches for crying out loud and just save folks money...I learned the valuable lesson:  you pay for a gimmick cool factor and nothing more and then pay again to keep it going.  What a joke.My thoughts on this watch:I'd had a mechanical watch before that was junk, but researching a few and Invicta, it seemed a more solid choice, especially considering the price- about a capacitor replacement on one of the others!  I figured I'd roll the dice, and if it lasts a few years, it'll be better than the others, especially considering it's hundreds less, though it certainly looks like a several hundred or even several thousand dollar watch...How does it stack up?  Time will tell.  I'll come back and update the review if/when it dies, or I notice anything else, but in the meantime-My impressions after a few months:  It's a flashy classic design that's gotten me complements and I keep looking at it in disbelief that I got it for so cheap compared to the prior watches.  It really is sharp looking.  It has a near enough to sweep second hand that the ticks are very slight.  Others have talked at length about the high-quality movement and number of jewels (the guts of this), and that info is impressive and influenced my choice considering I wanted something that would keep decent time and not require a battery.  The size is just right.  I certainly didn't want one of those giant thick and bulky watches that seem to be the only things available.  This is a bit thick, but not obnoxiously so.  It took a little getting used to over my last watch, but that was a slim titanium model, but after a couple days of it, I got used to it.It seems to keep good time through the week and although I'm not precisely checking it to the second, it lines up with the time on the computer when I do look at both.  If it's off by anything it's not by much.Very Minor Things:The thing won't last more than a day and change without you moving or winding it.  This has been frustrating on a couple of sick weekends or days where I'm not wearing it around the house.  I do not want to buy a watch winder... That means I have to stay on top of it or resign myself to setting it again- which is a bit of a pain when you go to synchronize and push in the crown and start to twist it to close it and realize you've budged the minute hand and have to try synching it again.  Dang it.  Not a biggie and it's my fault for not staying on top of it... just wish it could go the weekend untouched.I miss the \"day\" feature of my eco-drive, but the date is good enough and I realize adding \"complications\" drives up price.I don't like the magnifier, and have found it a bit annoying as I can't just glance down and read the date, I have to position my wrist to look straight at it or the magnifier occludes it.Others have complained about the shiny gold or silver scratching.  Anything shiny will scratch.  This is no different.  I don't baby it, but I don't abuse it either.  I've noticed some very fine scratches not apparent to a casual observation- you don't see them just looking at the time or even at the band, you have to focus and look.  Not an issue at all in my mind.",

                    "review": "When I saw this watch on the Black Friday doorbuster, it was just so cheap that I had to have one.In the watch world, Invicta is the butt of almost every joke because many of their models just completely fall apart on their own in a month or two and then the buyer ends up losing everything after finding out that the warranty only covers about half the watch, it costs money just to have them look at it and then claim it's not covered, etc.But the one watch that seems to get respect is the Pro Diver series with the Seiko NH35A movement.I bought this watch around the same time I also bought the Casio Pro Trek 6600-Y2 and while I think the Casio is nicer, the Invicta pro diver is a fine watch too, especially for the Black Friday price.It's got all of the basics covered. It's water-resistant (as long as you screw the crown down tightly), it's got the looks of the Rolex Submariner, which it's obviously a copy of, and (at least the one I got) keeps pretty good time. Loses a couple of seconds per day, which isn't bad for a low end automatic mechanical.This uses a very similar movement to the Seiko 5 series, which is fair bit more expensive.Invicta has a reputation for making some really gaudy, garish, and obnoxious watch designs, but this one isn't wild. It's a copy of a classic. Probably the only thing they did with it that I don't like is the laser-etched \"INVICTA\" on the left size of the watch, since Invicta isn't generally a watch name you want to scream.But still, if you want a cheap, decent, watch to run until the hands fall off, this is your watch.The manual for this specific watch doesn't seem to be included in the box as some sort of cost-cutting measure by Invicta, and must be read online.Probably the most important thing I read in it was when I couldn't figure out how to get the date window to work and it turned out you're not supposed to set the date between 9 PM and 4 AM or the thing will not work right. So I waited until after 4 AM and set the date to the previous day, then pulled the crown out all the way and changed the time forward until the date rolled over, and then set the time and pushed the crown back in, and it's been working right ever since.The automatic winding rotor is a bit loud, but it's not aggravatingly so.The 41 hour power reserve is quite sufficient as long as you wear it regularly or keep it winded up after you take it off (which is position 0 of three on the crown, from which you can manually wind the watch).Invicta suggests having the movement serviced every so often, but honestly the watch is so cheap that if anyone wants to charge you anything to fix it, you may as well toss it and buy a new watch. That's not so bad really.Many people have these things run for years without many problems, whereas I've heard of people complaining that if they don't get a $700 \"servicing\" for their Rolex every 4 years, it starts losing 15 minutes a day.Overall: If you need a beater watch that looks decent and don't want to be plagued by battery swaps, and don't mind resetting it to the correct time every few weeks, this is a good choice.",

                    "review": "My first dive watch was Seiko's first dive watch, the 62 MAS introduced in 1965.  I've collected watches ever since.The watch pictured next to my Ball Skindiver is the Seiko Prospex Reinterpretation of that original watch, their newer 1965 Automatic Diver's Watch SPB051J1.  I wore that original Seiko dive watch for more than 20 years without service of any kind, through thousands of dives.  Their new \"reinterpretation\" is much improved.I bought my first Invicta 9937 to replace that original Seiko many years ago, mostly because I liked the Submariner look, and it served me wonderfully well until a close friend talked me out of it.  I bought a new one to replace it ... the 9937 is my favorite Invicta dive watch hands down.So much for the history, but I thought it might be relevant to those considering a purchase.  This review will cover and compare the currently available Invicta 9937, and its less expensive cousin, the Invicta 8926.  Both are pictured above side-by-side ... you will note that they are virtually identical. in appearance, but significantly different in cost.  In my view, the 9937 is the better watch, worth the difference in cost, but \"your mileage may vary.\"  This review is posted under both watches.There are MANY good reviews of both watches on Amazon, but if you look at the dates, many are old, and address QC issues that have long been resolved.If you look closely at the picture of both watches side by side, you'll note that they are running within seconds of each other, which is remarkable since they were set several days ago according to the NIST time clock ... the 9937 is about 2 seconds fast, and the 8926 is about 2 seconds slow.  That sort of accuracy is NOT to be expected of ANY mechanical watch.  My most expensive, COSC Certified, mechanical watches gain, on average, about 3 seconds a day.  I found this to be quite surprising.The luminescence on both watches is identically pitiful.  They glow, sort of, but compared to my other (NON-Tritium) watches sitting in the exact same conditions (watch boxes), they might as well not have bothered ... removed to a totally dark room, my SEIKO (my best non-tritium) lume) watch is very clear to read, whereas these are invisible.  If you need to tell time in the dark, these are a total bust, and one is no better than the other.  I am a great fan of Tritium tubes that do NOT fade overnight ... they can be expected to glow exactly the same for 25 years.  The watch manufacturers like Ball, Nite, Luminox, etc., that use Tritium tubes are the way to go if it is important to you to be able to read your watch in the dark.The bracelets on dive watches are very important.  Lose a single pin, screw, ... whatever, to corrosion,  or have the clasp fail, and your watch falls to the bottom of the sea.  These bracelets are almost identical, except the clasp,  I never had an issue with my 9937's, and I would not expect an issue with either of these.  Both bracelets appear to be finished identically, and they feel exactly the same on the wrist, which is to say quite comfortable and, although the clasps are the same general design (with a security fold over) they are made differently, with the 9937 (top in pic) being the better design.  NEITHER watch bracelet has a diver's extension to accommodate a wet suit which surprised me.The dials may look identical in the picture, but they are not.  The 8926 is a gloss black, but the 9937 seems to have a SLIGHTLY more gray look.  The markers and indices are identical.The 9937 has a Sellita Swiss movement.  The 8926 has  a Japanese movement which I believe to be made by Seiko.  The difference is, you can manually wind the Sellita, but both are incredibly accurate and I have found both Seiko, and Sellita movements to be very reliable.  The main difference is the crown assembly ... the 9937 is smooth and precise feeling but the 8926 lacks that precision feel.The 9937 no longer has a sapphire crystal (I think my others did).  Instead, it is some sort of hardened mineral crystal they call \"flame fusion.\"  The 8926 has the basic mineral crystal, which should scratch more easily ... but I have never scratched one.The bezel assemblies are both tight and precise feeling with the same micro click system on both.  The engineering is MUCH better than on some of my more expensive watches.  The insert fits flush with the bezel, and mates to the crystal perfectly.  They are not quite identical, in that the markings on the 8926 seem a bit more \"crisp\" to me.They claim that both watches are depth rated to 200M and both are listed as suitable for diving.  Both have screw in case backs, and both have screw down crowns.  The reality is, divers these days almost universally use dive computers, so it isn't like the old days when your dive watch was critical.  For diving, I wear my Seiko ... but that may be just an old man's preference based on nostalgia.The bottom line, I think the 9937 is the better watch, and probably worth the price difference, but I found none of the issues with the 8926 that were reported in old reviews.  The construction, fit and finish is excellent on both watches, they feel and look exactly the same on my wrist, and I simply cannot account for the accuracy, which is phenomenal.If you are not sure what you will need, or like, I'd suggest the 8926 ... wear it a while and decide if the design and function suits you.  For less than $80, you cannot go far wrong and, if it turns out that you like the design of a divers sport watch, you can always upgrade to a better watch of similar design later.I hope this is helpful to someone.",

                    "review": "It\u2019s no secret that the Rolex Submariner is a very popular design. I wanted to try out the size and style before deciding to save for a Rolex myself and figured the cheapest way to do this would be to pick one of the many low cost homages that are out there. Of all of them, I figured I\u2019d try out the Invicta Pro Diver 8926ob. And I got a great deal picking this one up on Amazon Prime Day. I picked it up for well under the standard asking price of $85 and at this price, I can highly recommend it.THE GOOD: The size on this piece is what I love the most. Light enough to be very comfortable and heavy enough to not forget you are wearing a quality watch. I definitely love the look of the thinner lugs. I think it makes the watch wear smaller vs. the current Rolex Maxi Case versions. The signed crown is a nice touch in this price range. Bezel action on my model is good, a little back play so not rock solid by any stretch. The cyclops magnifies just fine and is nice to have, I like it. The movement is the star of the show with this watch. I could have gone with a Chinese Loreo or an even cheaper Tevise, but I wanted a better known name on the dial and the unbranded Seiko NH35 movement this comes with. With that said, it is running about +12-14 seconds which is still within the recommended tolerances for this movement. You can\u2019t get this movement at this price range, even in a Seiko watch and most micro brands are leaning on this movement in their much higher priced ($300-500) models. This is the reason you get this watch. The exhibition case back is a nice touch, great for an entry level piece and to get people into the hobby. It does add a little height to the head of the watch so be aware of that especially if you plan to put it on a nato strap.THE BAD: The lume is not good on the indices on the dial and the second hand. Almost not visible after a minute or two of darkness. The hands and lume pip on the bezel are ok, visible after a few minutes they start to fade fast. The bracelet is nothing special either, the hollow end links and the pressed clasp remind you what you paid for the watch. The center link on the bracelet is polished, it\u2019s not my favorite but I have\u2019t worn this watch on any other strap since I\u2019ve gotten it. I wish the lugs and the end link on the bracelet matched in size from the case edge to the lug end but again, at this price point, there are some corners cut. The brushing on the lugs is a little rough on my model, wish it was a little cleaner. I don\u2019t love the large Invicta logo etched into the side of the case but I honestly don\u2019t see it much while I\u2019m wearing it so it doesn\u2019t bother me.Overall, I\u2019m incredibly pleased with this purchase. I feel that the watch size and weight (which are similar to the Rolex Submariner) are quite perfect proportionally and can understand why it is such a popular watch design. I don\u2019t have any qualms with Invicta as a brand. I understand that they are not popular in the watch collecting community from a quality and a design standpoint. This watch and this price range is necessary as not everyone can afford a Rolex Submariner, I place myself firmly in this group of people. As I said earlier, if you can get this one at a price lower than what it\u2019s listed for (generally $85), I\u2019m saying in the $55-65 range, I highly recommend it but not at $85.",

                    "review": "I first purchased the Invicta 8926OB in December 2018 and I'm writing this review in July 2023. It was my first automatic watch and despite now having a collection of almost two dozen, including much more expensive pieces, the pro diver still gets the most wrist time. I've worn this thing in all sorts of conditions and occasions, including while traveling, swimming, in the gym, and on duty as a firefighter/emt. It is a tough watch that has aged gracefully over the years.Let's first talk about the looks. Obviously, it borrows a lot in that department from the piece that it pays homage to, the Rolex Submariner, which costs in the range of $13,000 and unobtainable unless you already have an established relationship with your Rolex dealer, or pay a premium in the used market.Of course, we can't directly compare an $80 watch to a $13,000 watch, but due to Rolex's rich, near century-old history, this particular look has become timeless and easily one of the most recognizable in the world, and the Invicta 8926OB gives you a solid taste of that heritage, even down to its mechanical movement, for a tiny fraction of the price.Its 40mm case size is considered solidly medium and should fit well on all but the smallest of male wrists. At 13mm in height, the case is quite tall and you may have trouble slipping it under a tight shirt cuff, especially if you wear it on a NATO strap which will add more height. However, this height is not out of the ordinary for an automatic dive watch.The bracelet is quite comfortable, and includes several micro-adjustment slots so you should have no problem getting a decent fit. It does not, however, have a diver's extension. Overall, the clasp is made out of cheaply stamped steel and the end links are hollow which is to be expected at this price point, but for me this has not been an issue and the bracelet has held up just fine over the years. I currently have it on a leather strap as you can see in my photos, but for most of its time with me it has stayed on the bracelet. With a 20mm lug width you should have no problems finding after market straps.The movement is the revered Seiko NH35A, which has proven itself to be a staple of reliable performance in the entry level to several hundred dollar price range. I think the fact that Invicta is able to use the NH35 and still maintain a sub $100 price point is quite impressive and you're getting a lot of value for your money here.If you're new to automatic/mechanical watches though, you should be aware that though mechanical movements will never require a battery change, they are a lot more fragile than your typical quartz movements and will require some care. Mainly, you should avoid hard hits and drops, and keep them away from magnetic fields including the one emitted by your phone. If your mechanical watch is running very inaccurately, as in off by more than 30 seconds per day, it is possible to make adjustments to the movement to get it back on track. You could either take it to a watch repair place or learn to do it yourself if you're confident.At 200m of water resistance, the watch should hold up to all but the most intense of maritime activities. It has proper rubber gaskets under the screw-down crown as well as the screw down caseback, but it does also have an exhibition window which could become a weak point under pressure, so I would hesitate to take it on a serious scuba dive of more than 10-20m. It should have no problem in any other scenario though.My only criticism of this watch that would be fair to make at its price point is its lume. In addition to being extremely weak (the hands will stay visible for a couple minutes but the indices die off pretty much immediately), it is also a yellowish-green color which I do not like. I'm not sure if Invicta was going for some sort of patina look, but it is quite ugly and cheapens the overall look of the watch, in my opinion. I would much rather they have just gone with white, or a more amber color for a proper patina look.Some have also complained that there's too much branding on the watch. The only branding that I see that isn't found on almost all other watches is the one on the side of the case, which I honestly don't mind because I rarely notice it.Overall, if you're on the fence about buying one of these pro divers, don't hesitate to do so because you won't be disappointed. It would make a great first automatic watch, or a solid addition to an existing collection. If you plan to be rough with your watch though, I would suggest going for one of the stainless steel ones instead of any of the gold plated ones which could scratch off over time.",

                    "review": "Escribo esta rese\u00f1a en ESPA\u00d1OL porque casi todas son en Ingles y para tratar de orientar a ese gran p\u00fablico de habla hispana, aunque con el traductor inmediatamente alguien que hable solo ingles puede entender el sentido de lo escrito.Es sobre el reloj 8926 OB de INVICTA , un reloj de buzo o diver homenaje al Submariner de Rolex pero con la marca Invicta claramente definida, haciendo hincapi\u00e9 en que ese Rolex ha sido copiado e imitado por muchas empresas relojeras del mundo (tengo entendido que Rolex nunca patent\u00f3 el dise\u00f1o).  No critico a Invicta por hacer un  reloj casi igual especialmente si no tengo la capacidad de tener un  Rolex de 10.000 d\u00f3lares y si los tuviera es mas probable que estar\u00eda metido en una caja y saldr\u00eda con el solo para un sitio muy exclusivo o una fiesta. Con lo que vale el Rolex (mas como inversi\u00f3n) me compro unos 100 Invictas hasta para regalar por lo que me parece fuera de contexto una comparaci\u00f3n que vi en You tube sobre este reloj y el Submariner. Hoy en d\u00eda una persona sensata no se va a exponer en la calle a un robo a mano armada -en cualquier parte del mundo- por el que un ladr\u00f3n es capaz hasta de hacer da\u00f1o para llevarse f\u00e1cilmente el Rolex. Con este Invicta podemos lucir tranquilos un buen reloj de s\u00f3lida construcci\u00f3n y de detalles bien acabados y con un brazalete que si no es perfecto, es de buena calidad. Que si tiene un grabado que dice Invicta, que si el \u00faltimo eslab\u00f3n es hueco, son cosas insignificantes para mi si me siento c\u00f3modo con este reloj que creo que cumple con las expectativas.El hecho de que tenga miles de rese\u00f1as positivas ya es un aval. Es cierto que a alguien puede haberle salido mal la corona, o que se le desprendi\u00f3 el bisel o que este es un poco duro. Son excepciones, el 90 % cree que es un buen reloj incluyendo a los muchos You Tubers relojeros que dan opini\u00f3n positiva ya que este es el reloj mas revisado y comentado en You Tube y el que tiene mas rese\u00f1as en Amazon.Recordemos que este es un movimiento Seiko autom\u00e1tico NH35A y no es exacto.  Los relojes de bater\u00eda son mucho mas exactos con variaci\u00f3n de hasta 1 segundo por d\u00eda. Hasta el mejor reloj mec\u00e1nico autom\u00e1tico de miles de d\u00f3lares tiene adelantos o retrasos y creo que en mi caso un adelanto de 10 a 12 segundos diario es casi insignificante. Puedo vivir con eso y ajustarlo una vez a la semana, adem\u00e1s me hace llegar a tiempo y no tarde.Los detalles del reloj como los acabados, su corona, el bisel que no tiene juego y bien centrado lo hacen lucir como un reloj de 500 $ y no de 86 $ que fue lo me cost\u00f3. Algunos critican el cepillado porque lo ven un poco burdo ( no es un Rolex, ni un Longines, ni un Omega). Yo lo veo bien y el reloj luce en general buen acabado y buena construcci\u00f3n. La esfera tiene los logos y letras de la marca aplicados en relieve y no pintados como por ejemplo los traen los Tissot de 500 o 1.000 $.Hay muchos modelos de Invicta tipo Diver e incluso este modelo tambi\u00e9n viene  con bater\u00eda pero siempre un reloj autom\u00e1tico mec\u00e1nico es un complejo mecanismo de relojer\u00eda (visible en la parte trasera de este reloj), es mas reloj y solo hay que usarlo para que se mantenga activo. Este lo dejo toda la noche sobre la mesa y no se para ( por cierto los que no traen pintado el rotor autom\u00e1tico de amarillo tambi\u00e9n son leg\u00edtimos, no se preocupe que son variaciones del reloj al igual que la caja puede venir no amarilla sino en un sobrio gris. Un reloj de bater\u00eda tendr\u00e1 que abrirlo cada 2 a 4 a\u00f1os para reemplazar la pila y esto puede hacerle perder la impermeabilidad de f\u00e1brica lo que no suceder\u00eda con este. Solo se abrir\u00e1 si le va a hacer un servicio y bien cuidado puede durar muchos a\u00f1os. Hay relojes que compiten con este como la marca china Pagano Design mucho mas caros porque traen un cristal de zafiro y no cristal mineral como este pero tienen mas comentarios negativos y podemos decir que una marca de tradici\u00f3n como Invicta y bien posicionada- ahora estadounidense con sede en Florida- tiene buena reputaci\u00f3n y da mas confianza aunque haga relojes grandes y de estilo rococ\u00f3 que a algunos no le gusten (a mi tampoco). Eso no me importa mientras fabriquen modelos bonitos y de calidad que tienen. Siempre habr\u00e1 publico par ese tipo de relojes y si los mantienen es porque los venden. Esta marca tiene cientos de modelos para todos los gustos.En conclusi\u00f3n:el 8926 es un reloj que recomiendo por tener mas virtudes y puntos positivos que defectos los cuales son imperceptibles. Un gasto de menos de 100 d\u00f3lares en este reloj es ciertamente un valor de calidad precio dif\u00edcil de conseguir. Es tambi\u00e9n algo de mala suerte que venga con alg\u00fan defecto pero por ese precio no creo que consiga algo mejor. Con respecto al servicio de Invicta que algunos critican no estoy seguro ni puedo asegurar que no es as\u00ed pero por 86 $ antes de mandar a repararlo preferir\u00eda comprar uno nuevo si el costo de env\u00edo me sale casi igual que el precio del reloj nuevo. Para finalizar quiero decir que este reloj lo recib\u00ed el los Estados Unidos en viaje que hice vacaciones en apenas 12 horas con el servicio de Amazon Prime en periodo de prueba. Elimin\u00e9 el servicio por considerar que no es beneficioso si no se vive all\u00e1 pero me pareci\u00f3 excelente.Nota: har\u00e9 una revisi\u00f3n o review dentro de unos meses para evaluarlo nuevamente pues este es con apenas mes y medio de uso.Recomiendo a las personas que dejan comentarios colocar siempre el modelo que analizan",

If you travel and want a Watch that can take a beating but also offer tons of functionality, the Casio World Time Watch is what you need. I found the Watch on sale for $23.99 and didn\u2019t hesitate to purchase it. What a FANTASTIC buy! Casio makes quality budget Watches, and I own several that sit next to my higher-end branded Watches.The World Time offers a nice aesthetic design, an alarm function, 31 time zones with a daylight savings time toggle, a stopwatch AND timer function, and you can even set up an hourly chime. The light function ensures you have illumination in the darkest places, and with a 10-year battery life, this Watch is a no-brainer for any serious Watch collector\u2019s wrist.With all the cool things you get, the part that is a little disappointing is that the case is a resin painted to look like metal, and the glass is just glass and not a harder substance. When the Chinese make mechanical Watches with steel cases and sapphire glass for $50, you may wonder if the Casio is worth the purchase price. It is definitely worth the purchase price. I\u2019ve found the resign cases are resilient to bumps and bruises, and I\u2019ve never broken the glass on one of my Casios. I also know my Casio will outlive any cheap Chinese-made knock-off Watch.Who should buy the Casio World Time? Anyone who loves sleek digital Watches and needs a lot of functionality. It\u2019s a great looking Watch on your wrist and has every function imaginable if you travel. It\u2019s a straightforward Watch from a brand known for its quality budget Watches. If you want something super durable, you\u2019ll need to upgrade to a G-Shock, but for most uses, the World Time Casio will be perfect for you.Pros: Great price, great value, sleek look, and tons of functionality. This Watch offers more functions than you\u2019ll probably ever use. The 10-year battery life is stellar.Cons: The bracelet links are hard to change, and you will need a super small screwdriver and patience. I was able to remove some links but ended up taking it to a jeweler to size.",

                    "review": "This is my favorite Casio watch I think. Even with my small collection of G-Shocks, and a few other Casio models, this is my favorite. This watch is my go to at home functional watch and my watch when I need to be really mindful of the time when I am out.Functions:Excellent backlight for Casio. Casio usually has ok backlights (Never quite as good as Timex), but the low end casio watches are usually lacking...not this one. It has a good backlight that lasts for a second or two when pressed that illuminates the entire time readout. This is a huge win for me as I use a light frequently to check a watch at night and in the early morning.Timer and Stopwatch: These are both on the watch and easy to use. They are effective at what they do and the alarms are load enough to hear them with mild ambient sound. Maybe not so much in a super loud environment, but normally I do not think this would be an issue.World Time: Also very easy to figure out and has an awesome map. I split my time between London and Los Angeles as we have our International office located in the UK and I like to readily know what time it is for my team out there. I also love the map, it makes it easy to tell when you are approaching the right timezone so you don't always blow passed it when searching for your own. Not to mention I just enjoy the aesthetics.Size and Style: This watch is very light for being pretty big. It is true to size and does not wear much bigger that it seems. I have small rests, but it feels comfortable and looks good. It does have some retro styling, this watch has not changed in a long time, and I feel that is a strong positive for it. It looks good. I have both this version and the round one, and this one is way better. The pushers on the round one are not metal. I took the band off and paired it with a Barton Brand green canvas 18mm band and it looks real nice.Some people mod these a little, or at least remove the wording on the case. I left mine alone, and will probably not attempt to mod it. The strap it comes with is comfortable enough, but cheap, so I would recommend another 18mm band. The Barton Brand 18mm quick fitting buckle band looked really good on this.So, for the price of the watch and maybe another 15 bucks, you can get an excellent all around watch that has functionality to perform tons of jobs around the house and even in travels for less than $50. I plan on using this whenever I am abroad for its ease of use, durability, and cost if it is broken or stolen. And yes the watch has good water resistance and has stood up through washing dishes, showers, getting knocked around during yard work, etc. Yes, it will pick up scratches, but the case and plastic crystal hold up pretty well for all of that.I highly recommend this watch.",

The backlight is decent (I don't like the orange but that's nitpicky). It's got a cool retro look and is refreshing coming from an Apple Watch.I'm a fan!",

                    "review": "Last updated: 7 Aug. 2019, 3 yrs. 9 months after original purchase.I purchased this watch Nov 2015, and the band broke June 2017. The band lasted just over 1.5 years. Note that I wore it 24/7 the *entire* 1.5 years! I literally only took it off to switch wrists probably 4 times over that period. It was on all day, all night, in the shower, in the pool, at the beach, in sports, etc etc you get the point.  I love this watch because it is super cheap (~$15) yet it has multiple alarms and a countdown timer instead of just a stopwatch timer. It's basically a G-shock quality watch for $15 instead of $45.When the band did break, it broke very suddenly! I didn't see any cracks on it or anything, but I literally rubbed my wrist across an object while turning and the band tore in two and the whole watch fell right off my wrist. Upon closer inspection, I saw cracks all along the inside of the band against my wrist, and if I bent the band hard it would break in other locations too.So, replaced the band with a nice durable nylon nato strap! I used this one (",

                    "review": "I travel across time zones frequently, and bought this watch for the simplicity it provides for switching between time zones.  It has five basic functions - home time, world time (zones), countdown timer, stopwatch, and alarm. (Along with your home-base time, you can set four additional time zones to switch to very easily; and you can set up to five alarms.)  When the digital display is set for one of your chosen secondary time zones, the little analog watch face stays on your home time. And the world map highlights the time zone which your digital display is set to.  I used the alarm this morning for my wake-up alarm, and it was plenty loud enough.  The instruction booklet has very small print, and I definitely had to study it under direct light to read it; but I've learned to navigate through the basic functions very easily, and I'm not the most tech-savvy person in the world.  It fits lightly on the wrist.  As you will read on all the reviews, the orange illuminator function is very bright.  I discovered this gem by googling, \"Best men's watches for under $50.\" Many Casio models were on the list, including the World Time model, which Amazon sells for under $20. I am very pleased.",

                    "review": "Whether you have heard about this watch, or if you have not and are just stumbling across it, it is a great watch, so long as you are aware of a couple things that are annoying enough to make me dock one star (but it is still fantastic!):1) Be very careful when removing and reinstalling the back cover. You probably won't ever need to, but if you do, do NOT over tighten the screws when reinstalling the cover, as the screws are metal but thread into plastic, and the plastic threads will get stripped if you over tighten. Best to tighten only until snug, or better yet just don't remove the cover at all.2) The crystal (front transparent panel, if you don't know much about watches) is plastic, and WILL get scratched. You cannot really prevent this without a screen protector, which I don't suggest spending money on, as this watch is meant to be a very cheap beater. Just be aware that the shiny clear front that you see when you open the box will not stay that way for long.I bought this watch for $16, and as a person who is not really into watches in general, I could not be happier. The world time and map display are actually super cool and work very well, and the ability to see your local time zone AND home time at any moment by just glancing on your wrist is awesome. The \"analog\" clock in the upper left is awesome, as you can keep the time shown at all times including when you are running a timer and stopwatch, which is something that even many smart watches don't do. It is super light and comfy to the point where I can lounge at home and almost forget I am wearing it (although maybe not quite so much that I can sleep in it). It FEELS like it costs (all plastic), but it still somehow feels... good to wear?The alarms are wonderful. Having up to 5 at once is super useful, and I LOVE that you can set the alarms to turn off after they go off OR make them go off every day. Be advised, the alarms will always go off according to your T-1 time ( the time displayed on your upper left \"analog\" clock), so if you change time zones and use daily alarms make sure you set the T-1 time from your home time zone to your current LOCAL time zone upon reaching your destination (super easy to by pressing both upper buttons). The hourly chimes are good too, loud enough to remind you that time is passing, but not so loud that they are distracting or startling. I wish there was a way to auto disable them during sleeping hours, but at this price beggars can't be choosers.I am absolutely blown away by how capable this thing is for this price. I am struggling to understand how the F91W is so popular after seeing how much more capable this thing is for essentially the same price. I plan to use it as a beater watch for working around the house and garage, and as a travel watch that I don't have to care about in terms of getting damaged, lost, or submerged while swimming.",

The bracelet is surpringly good, although I wouldnt say the best.  But what makes this watch so cool is the retro styling of the watch face, people especially the younger crowd will ask about it.On a side note this watch is extremely popular to mod, skxmod makes a variety.",
